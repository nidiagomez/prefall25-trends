# 👠 From the Runway to Your Closet: Pre-Fall 2025 Trend Tracker

> *"That blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs… You're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room—from a pile of 'stuff'."*  
> — *The Devil Wears Prada (2006)*

This project explores how **Pre-Fall 2025 runway trends** make their way from elite designer collections into **mainstream fashion**—ultimately shaping what we see in stores and wear in everyday life.

Through curated visuals, data storytelling, and fashion editorial analysis, the project:
- Highlights key themes from the 2025 Pre-Fall season (colors, silhouettes, fabrics)
- Traces how these trends appear in fashion media (like Vogue)
- Examines their diffusion into retail and consumer markets

👗 **Goal:** To reveal the invisible thread connecting luxury fashion and mass-market style—and show that even what seems like “just a blue sweater” is rooted in intentional, top-down industry decisions.

🎯 **Audience:**  
Fashion enthusiasts, aspiring designers, students, industry analysts, and curious consumers who want to understand the lifecycle of a trend.
